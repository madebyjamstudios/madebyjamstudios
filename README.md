THE GOOD STUFF, CAPTURED  
We’re a photographer + videographer duo (Atlanta). We document real moments — no fluff, no forced posing. We also run an AV company and build small code tools that make shoots and workflows faster: booking, asset automation, on-site tools and delivery pipelines.

What we do
- Photo + video for weddings, elopements, engagements, couples, and lifestyle
- Full production: cinematics, drone, and multi-camera AV
- Custom tooling: scripts, apps, and automations that streamline field work
