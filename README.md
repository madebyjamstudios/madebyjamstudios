**The good stuff, captured.**  
We're a photographer + videographer duo based in Atlanta. We document real moments — no fluff, no forced posing. We also run an AV company and build small code tools that make shoots and workflows faster: booking, asset automation, on-site tools, and delivery pipelines.

**What we do**

- Photo + video for weddings, elopements, engagements, couples, and lifestyle
- Full production: cinematics, drone, and multi-camera AV
- Custom tooling: scripts, apps, and automations that streamline field work
